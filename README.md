# Hello-world
It's my first time using GitHub, I'm happy!
# today, I will teach U using Python to calculate the sum of one to one hundred.

s = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    s += i
print(s)

# U can calculate the sum of one to one hundred just input the above codes.
It's nothing serious, U're welcome.
